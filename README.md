# Plans
This is the repo for managing a schema being used to define the plans available for APIs, describing what API consumers have access to, and what resources will cost.

## Resources
Right now there is only two artifacts to describe plan schema, with more working occurring regularly based upon work profiling existing APIs and describing new APIs.

- [Example One](plans-example-1.yml) - An example plans schema defining access tier for APIs.io.
- [JSON Schema](plans-json-schema.yml) - The beginning JSON Schema for defining and validating.

## Support
This schema is reported using the issues on this GitHub repository--if there is some feature you'd like to see, or have questions, please submit an issue.
